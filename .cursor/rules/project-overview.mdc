# Nutrition Website Project Guidelines

## Project Architecture
- This is a Next.js 15 application using the App Router
- Uses Prisma with PostgreSQL (Supabase) for database operations
- Authentication via NextAuth.js
- Styling with TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI components
- AWS S3 for file storage (videos, images, audio)

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all components and functions
- Prefer functional components with React hooks
- Follow the component structure defined in REPO_STRUCTURE.md
- Separate server and client components appropriately
- Use server actions for form submissions and data mutations
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables

## Component Organization
- Server components should handle data fetching and authentication
- Client components should handle interactivity and state
- Reusable UI components should be placed in the components directory
- Page-specific components should be co-located with their pages

## Authentication
- Two user roles: ADMIN and CLIENT
- Admin creates user accounts (no self-registration)
- Check user roles and subscription status in server components
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- Redirect unauthorized users to appropriate error pages

## Database Operations
- Use Prisma Client for all database operations
- Implement proper error handling for database queries
- Follow the schema definitions in SCHEMA.md
- Use transactions for operations that modify multiple tables

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow the design aesthetic from the provided inspiration images
- Use a clean, minimalist design with an earthy color palette
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
